# Wariskmin - **Wa**llet Data Visualization for **Risk** **Min**imization

This project is a Python-based visualization tool that aims to help investors minimize risks while building a diversified portfolio. It calculates the covariance and distance of stock prices time series and uses clustering algorithms to group stocks based on their correlation, allowing users to visualize and gain insights about risk on their wallets.

The software is built using the following libraries:

* Streamlit: A web framework for building interactive data-driven applications.
* NumPy: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
* yfinance:  provides an easy-to-use interface for retrieving historical market data, such as stock prices, dividends, and splits, from Yahoo Finance. Not affiliated, endorsed, or vetted by Yahoo, Inc. It's an open-source tool that uses Yahoo's publicly available APIs, and is intended for **research and educational purposes**. 

This project is being developed in the context of the *CMP596 - Visual Analytics for Data Science* course in the [PPGC program at INF/UFRGS](https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/ppgc/), and is not intended for commercial use.

# Other remarks

The author is enthusiastic about ChatGPT and will be using it for bits and pieces throughout the project, like the creation of this readme file. The chat couldn't make all the readme file, but helped by building a sketch.
